### Rust+ Notifications
Rust+ notifications is a project designed to relay information from the Rust world to discord using the Rust Companion app available on mobile. At the moment the bot uses webhooks, I plan to create a comprehensive discord bot in the future. The project is created using the [rustplus.js](https://github.com/liamcottle/rustplus.js) library.

### Requirements 
Due to the unofficial nature of the library in question, you're required to manually retrieve your player token for each instance of the bot. I may look into a simpler solution in the future.
